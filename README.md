# CuraToZ18
I got a MakerBot Z18 printer. I wanted to use it with a modern slicer. My idea was that the UltiMaker Method and Replicator+ series also communicates with makerbot files, maybe I can get the Z18 to eat it. I only had to change a few things and I got the best result by far.
This version works only with Cura 5.11!

MANUAL:

After installing Cura 5.11, you need to run install.py.

This will make any necessary changes and installs the new files.
It will create a backup of the modified files.

You can then start Cura.

You can then send the sliced makerbot file to your Z18 printer using MakerBot Print or MakerBot Desktop.

Due to firmware limitations, changing the extruder temperature during printing does not work. I'm trying to find a workaround.

Happy printing!

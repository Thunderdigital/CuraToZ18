# CuraToZ18
I got a MakerBot Z18 printer. I wanted to use it with a modern slicer. My idea was that the UltiMaker Method series also communicates with makerbot files, maybe I can get the Z18 to eat it. I only had to change a few things and I got the best result by far.

MANUAL:

After installing Cura, you need to replace 2 files with the ones found here.

-ultimaker_method_base.def.json

-ultimaker_methodx.def.json

These are in the
C:\Program Files\UltiMaker Cura 5.10.2\share\cura\resources\definitions
folder. It is worth keeping the original, renaming it.
e.g. ultimaker_method_base.def.json.orig; ultimaker_methodx.def.json.orig

Do the same with

-ultimaker_methodx_extruder_left.def.json

in 
C:\Program Files\UltiMaker Cura 5.10.2\share\cura\resources\extruders 
folder.

Then put the

-print_bed_makerbot_replicator_z18.stl

file in the
C:\Program Files\UltiMaker Cura 5.10.2\share\cura\resources\meshes
folder. This actually just displays the Z18 bed in Cura, but I think it looks nice. ðŸ˜Š

You can then start Cura.

Add a printer:

-Add new

-UltiMaker Printer

-Add Local Printer

-Add a non-networked-printer

-UltiMaker Method X


Then you need to change a few parameters in the Machine Settings / Printer tab:

X (Width) 305mm

Y (Depth) 305mm

Z (Height) 457mm

Start G-code and End G-code are BLANK

X min -20 mm

Y min -20mm

X max 20mm

Ymax 20mm

Gantry Height 457mm

Number of Extruders 1

Of course, you can rename your printer to Makerbot Z18.

Once you are done with all this, you can start preparing the print and slicing in Cura.
Once you have your makerbot file ready and saved to your computer, run the CuraToZ18.py script on it.

Usage: python CuraToZ18.py <filename.makerbot> or CuraToZ18.exe <filename.makerbot> or drag and drop.

You can then send the converted makerbot file to your Z18 printer using MakerBot Print or MakerBot Desktop.

Due to firmware limitations, changing the extruder temperature during printing does not work. I'm trying to find a workaround.

Happy printing!
